title: Spotify - New Social features
category: UX & UI Design
---

<p>Spotify is the most popular music and podcast streaming platform in the world. It focuses on giving a simple and intuitive experience of listening and finding music.</p>

<p>Despite allowing users to follow their friends and see what they’re listening to, the platform has not developed much further in this social field. To make this platform more social without forgetting its main goal implies thinking of this interaction between friends to be about sharing music.</p>

<p>The process of developing this project was the following:</p>
